WeblGL threejs Experiment on Procedurally Generated Flowers using Simplex Noise

- This project is meant as an experiment to try out WeblGL using the Three JS library.
- Did this in less than a few hours (over spare time)


Live demo here: https://hellomichaelloke.github.io/alien-flower-gen/

TODO (maybe in future if I got the time)
 - Better Procedural generation
 - A better UI (which is non-existent right now)
 - Physics =p..
 - Maybe optimize for mobile devices...
